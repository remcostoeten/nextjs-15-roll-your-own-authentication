# Architecture Overview

Raioa follows a custom-rolled architecture with a strong focus on modularity and separation of concerns.

## Core Principles

### Separation of Concerns

All logic is isolated to ensure maintainability and scalability. UI components, business logic, and data access are separated into distinct layers.

### Agnostic Design

Everything is built to be agnostic to underlying libraries and frameworks. For example:

- The database layer abstracts away ORM specifics
- Authentication is custom-built with minimal dependencies
- UI components can be swapped with minimal code changes

### Reusability

Features are designed to be portable across projects with minimal changes. Shared components and hooks are emphasized for consistency.

### Custom Solutions

Where possible, we build custom implementations for core functionalities rather than relying on third-party packages:

- Custom authentication with JWT using Jose
- Custom caching mechanisms
- Custom rate limiting

## Folder Structure

### `src/shared`

Contains any shared logic, components, hooks, or utilities used across the application:

- **UI Components**: Shared components like those from Shadcn (e.g., button, modal) are stored in `src/shared/components/ui/index.ts`
    - The `index.ts` exports all components for clean imports, aliased as `ui`
    - Example: `import { Button } from 'ui'`
- **Shared State**: Any shared state goes in `src/shared/state/`
- **Types**: Generic types are stored in `src/shared/types/`
- **Utils**: Shared utilities are in `src/shared/utils/`

### `src/components`

Holds singular-use components that are not shared across the app, such as headers or footers.

### `src/app`

Used exclusively for rendering views. Each page consists of a `page.tsx` and associated metadata. The actual content is imported from the `views` directory.

### `src/views`

Contains the UI composition for specific pages. Each view is SSR-focused, importing reusable components and blocks.

### `src/modules`

Contains all feature-specific code, organized by feature name. Each module contains:

- **API**: Queries and mutations co-located under the `api` folder

    ```
    src/modules/<feature>/api/
    ├── queries/
    │   ├── index.ts
    │   ├── get-user.ts
    │   └── get-transactions.ts
    ├── mutations/
    │   ├── index.ts
    │   ├── create-user.ts
    │   └── update-profile.ts
    ```

- **Models**: Zod schemas for validation

    ```
    src/modules/<feature>/models/
    ├── z.user.ts
    └── z.transaction.ts
    ```

- **State**: Feature-specific state management with Zustand

    ```
    src/modules/<feature>/state/
    └── use-feature-state.ts
    ```

- **Hooks**: Module-specific hooks
    ```
    src/modules/<feature>/hooks/
    ├── use-currency.ts
    └── use-feature-hook.ts
    ```

### `src/server`

Contains all database interactions and schemas:

- Database access is abstracted under an alias `db`
- Schemas are located in `src/server/db/schemas/index.ts`
- Database code is abstracted for easy ORM swapping

## Naming Conventions

1. **File Names**:

    - Use **kebab-case** for all filenames
    - One function per file where appropriate
    - Each folder has an `index.ts` for exports

2. **Imports**:

    - Use aliases for clarity and simplicity (e.g., `ui`, `db`)

3. **Components**:

    - Components are named in PascalCase

4. **Types**:
    - Prefer types over interfaces where possible

## Module Example

```text
src/modules/authentication/
├── api/
│   ├── queries/
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   ├── get-user.ts
│   │   └── get-session.ts
│   └── mutations/
│       ├── index.ts
│       ├── create-user.ts
│       └── update-profile.ts
├── models/
│   ├── z.user.ts
│   └── z.session.ts
├── state/
│   └── use-auth-state.ts
└── hooks/
    ├── use-auth.ts
    └── use-permissions.ts
```

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **UI Components**: Radix/Shadcn (though custom-built solutions are preferred)
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM (though easily swappable)
- **Authentication**: Custom with Jose for JWT
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
