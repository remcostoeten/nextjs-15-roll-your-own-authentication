# Metadata Scanner Tool

The Metadata Scanner Tool scans your project to identify pages that are missing important metadata, such as `title`, `description`, and other SEO-relevant attributes. It provides an interactive terminal UI where you can easily navigate through the missing pages and add the necessary metadata directly from the tool.

## Features

- Scans your project for pages missing metadata.
- Displays missing pages with paths in an interactive terminal UI.
- Allows you to add metadata like `title`, `description`, and more.
- Easy-to-use navigation and editing directly in the terminal.

## Good to know

This depends on the global metadata file setup in `src/core/config/metadata`

## Usage

Either run `pnpm metadata` or `python3 scripts/metadata/metadata-tool.py`

If missing packages just install them with `pip install`
