## To Document

Document what to document, including rough setup + file + preferably line number and solution (e.g. code block, tooltip, diagram, filetree)

tldr to explain:

-   src/core/scripts
-   generate-turso-db.py
-   src/shared/hooks/use-user.ts
-   src/shared/hooks/use-loading.ts
    -> combination of these two
    -> demo page or section in Docs
-   explain project structure
-   enviorment variables
-   validation env flag
-   indicator env flag
-   useUser hook client vs get-user server
-   useLoading hook
-   Roles (admin / user) + the hooks

## Versions

There are two versions. Barebones and more complete

Barebones is indicated with 🚗 💨

Full is indicated with 💨🚀

✅ means implemented
📍 means not implemented yet
🖇️ means need work

## User storage

Session is handled through JWT. User credentials are stored in a database. We use `drizzle-orm` as an ORM to interact with the database, which is `sqlite` via `Turso`. It has 500 free databases per user and billlion read/writes a month and setup is very easy. 📍 In `src/core/scripts` you can find script which auto creates a Turso database en copys the enviorment variables to your clipboard. Read the `readme.mdx` in that directory.

## Barebones 🚗 💨

`git checkout feature/barebones-version`

Consits off
✅ - Minimal project setup without any bloat following SOLID architecture
🖇️ - Register with credentials
🖇️ - Login with credentials
✅ - Access private/public routes through middleware
✅ - Session through JWT

## Advanced version 💨🚀

`git checkout master`

Consists off
✅ - More advanced project setup following SOLID architecture which serves a solid foundation for scalable projects.
✅ - Register with credentials - Password strength validation and 📍ui
📍 - Show hide password toggle

-   Login with credentials
    📍 - Show hide password toggle
    📍 - Remember me toggle through local storage
    📍 - Toast notification succes/error messages
    ✅ - Access private/public routes through middleware
    ✅ - Session through JWT
    🖇️ - Developer utillity component to indicate current session toggleable through a enviorment variable
    ✅ - Disable validation via env for testing purpose
    📍 - Dashboard route with current user information (session, credentials, token duration, any other user fields) - Little more advanced sign-up process for completer user profile stored in database
    📍 - A navbar with content based on session (e.g. do not show sign-in/up routes, show log out button)

## Docs rougly setup

1. intro.

-   Bash on other auth libs and cry how hard it is to setup

2. tech.
3. setup

-   Side by side tree comparison of barebones and advanced version

4. Features
    - Barebones
    - Advanced
5. User storage
6. Middleware
7. Deployment (db setup)
8. Possible improvements / roadmap

## Middleware

-   explain constant for protected routes
-   explain contant for public routes

## Nice to haves

-   Diagram of the project structure
-   CLI commands for setup
    -   Create next app with this template
    -   Turso database setup
-   CLI for integrating into existing project
-   Vercel temlpate
-   social oauth?
-   idk how resend works but maybe that too
    | - forgot password
    | - confirm registration
    |--> configurable via simple setup file with booleans

## usual kisses and goobyes

-- Ask for star because e-penor needs inccreasement
-- Link to socials

-   Twitter
-   Github
-   If due to skillisues i can not implement oauth ask others to contribute

MIT, Issues are creatable - no garantuees I will look into it.
